\usage{
middle_negative_test2(dx)
}
\arguments{
\item{dx}{A sequential change of SWE values. This is a vector object.}
}
\description{
For the D4 Method, we need to have five consecutive changes,
the ends of which are positive, and at most one of the three middles is
negative. This function takes the changes and returns a logical vector of
TRUEs when at most one of the three middles is negative.
