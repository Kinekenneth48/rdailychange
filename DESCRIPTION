Description: Spatial analysis of daily snow water equivalent (SWE). You provide 
    the spatial data in a data frame with SWE and other specified columns, tell 
    "rdailychange" which daily change to extract, which distribution(GEV or GP) 
    to fit to the  extracted observations, and how to map the ground snow load 
    mean recurrence intervals (MRIs) or return levels.
